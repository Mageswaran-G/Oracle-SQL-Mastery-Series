#  Oracle SQL & Database Architecture: The Complete Master Guide
### 6 Weeks of Knowledge | From "What is SQL?" to Database Architect

Welcome to my technical repository! This guide contains a curated deep-dive into the core pillars of Oracle Database management, covering everything from basic queries to high-performance data loading and security.

| **SQL Foundations** | DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, DQL, and RDBMS Architecture |
| **Data Filtering** | Relational & Special Operators (LIKE, BETWEEN, IS NULL) |
| **Functions** | Single-Row (UPPER, ROUND) vs. Aggregate (SUM, AVG) |
| **Environment** | SQL*Plus Tooling (SET LINESIZE, SPOOL, TIMING) |
| **Advanced Objects** | Indexes, Sequences, Synonyms, and Views |
| **Data Migration** | SQL*Loader (Direct Path Load, Control Files, .bad files) |

##  Featured Q&A Highlights

###  SQL*Loader: Why not just use Python?
Standard `INSERT` statements are slow for large datasets. **SQL*Loader** uses "Direct Path Load" to bypass database overhead, writing data directly to data blocks. It's the difference between moving a house one brick at a time vs. moving the whole structure at once.

###  The "Golden Rule" of GROUP BY
Any column in your `SELECT` list that is not part of an aggregate function **must** be listed in the `GROUP BY` clause. Missing this is the #1 cause of ORA errors for beginners!

###  DUAL Table: The Oracle Scratchpad
Need to calculate `2+2` or check the system date (`SYSDATE`)? Since SQL requires a `FROM` clause, we use the **DUAL** table—a special dummy table with one row and one column.

##  Essential Commands & Tools
- **TCL (Transaction Control):** Mastering `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT` for data integrity.
- **DCL (Data Control):** Managing security via `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.
- **Joins:** Deep dives into `INNER`, `LEFT`, `FULL OUTER`, and `SELF-JOINS`.
